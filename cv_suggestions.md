# CV Suggestions for the Spacial Senior Structural/Software Engineer Role (Revised)

Thank you for the new details. This information is a game-changer. The pyRevit development and data analysis work are powerful assets.

The original job description is a difficult fit due to the "Senior Structural Engineer" requirement. Our new strategy is to pivot away from that and instead present you as a **highly valuable AEC Software Developer and VDC Technologist** who builds practical tools for the construction industry. You're the person who understands the end-user because you've lived their problems.

---

### Overall Strategy (Revised)

Your CV's story is now: "I am a Civil Engineer specializing in VDC and Project Management who has become a hands-on software developer. I build custom tools (pyRevit plugins), data dashboards (PowerBI), and web applications that directly solve the daily challenges of engineering and design teams. My goal is to use my unique blend of domain knowledge and development skills to build the next generation of AEC software."

### 1. High-Impact Edits (What to Change)

#### **A. Title & Expertise Tags**
This is the most important change. It reframes your entire profile.

*   **Suggestion:**
    *   Change your title to: `Civil Engineer & AEC Software Developer`
    *   Update expertise tags to: `Python Development`, `BIM/VDC Automation`, `Data Analysis & Web Tech`

#### **B. Professional Summary (formerly Objective)**
This summary should immediately signal your unique value proposition.

*   **Suggested Replacement:**
    > A Civil Engineer and self-taught Software Developer with a Master's in Civil Engineering and a specialization in VDC/BIM. I have proven experience building practical tools for the AEC industry, including Python-based Revit plugins (pyRevit), large-scale data analysis dashboards (PowerBI), and interactive web applications. I am passionate about bridging the gap between engineering workflows and software development to create efficient, data-driven solutions. Eager to apply my skills in Python development and AEC process automation at Spacial.

### 2. Experience Section: Your New Centerpiece

This is where you prove your developer credentials. Integrate your projects directly into your job descriptions as professional accomplishments.

#### **A. VDC & BIM Engineer at Shapir LTD**
Transform this from a standard VDC role into a software development role.

*   **Suggested Rewrite:**
    > As a VDC & BIM Engineer, I focused on developing custom tools and data workflows to enhance project efficiency. My key accomplishments include:
    >
    > *   **Python-based Tool Development:** Developed and deployed several Revit plugins using `pyRevit` to automate repetitive tasks for the design team, addressing immediate workflow needs and increasing productivity.
    > *   **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Engineered a data pipeline to extract and analyze large-scale data from Autodesk Construction Cloud (ACC). Created interactive PowerBI dashboards to provide project insights, replacing manual reporting.
    > *   **Web Application Development:** Built a web-based Project Breakdown Structure (PBS) portal using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This tool features an intelligent search function with complex JSON data handling to integrate pricing data (Dekel) into the daily design workflow.
    > *   **BIM/VDC Coordination:** Led VDC initiatives and managed advanced BIM modeling for large-scale infrastructure projects. *(This grounds your development work in real-world application).*

#### **B. De-emphasize Older Roles**
To keep the focus on your recent developer experience, condense past roles like "Teaching Assistant (TAU-Online)" and "Logistics Officer" to a single line each. The Community Carpentry role should be removed.

### 3. Skills Section: Be Specific

Your skills section should read like a developer's.

*   **Suggested Structure:**

    *   **Languages & Backend:** Python, C, SQL
    *   **Python Ecosystem:** pyRevit, Pandas, NumPy, *[Mention Flask/FastAPI if you used them for Home Assistant]*
    *   **Data & Visualization:** PowerBI, Data Analysis, JSON
    *   **Web Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    *   **AEC Software:** Revit (Advanced), AutoCAD, Autodesk Construction Cloud (ACC)
    *   **AI:** Familiarity with LLM concepts and API integration (OpenAI API, Home Assistant)

### 4. Handling the "Structural Engineer" Gap

This is a key challenge that must be addressed, likely in a cover letter. Do not ignore it.

*   **Recommendation for your Cover Letter:**
    *   Acknowledge the requirement directly.
    *   Frame your Project Management background as a strength. It gives you a holistic view of the entire building lifecycle, which is crucial for a company like Spacial that aims to streamline the *entire engineering process*.
    *   **Example narrative:** "While my formal specialization is in Civil Engineering Project Management rather than structural design, this has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the entire project lifecycle, from initial design and coordination to final construction. My hands-on experience developing tools for VDC and design teams at Shapir demonstrates my ability to translate complex engineering requirements—structural or otherwise—into functional, efficient software logic. I am confident that my ability to understand and automate workflows across disciplines would be a significant asset to your team."

By implementing these changes, you present a powerful and, most importantly, accurate narrative of your skills and experience as a software developer in the AEC space.
